# Expand Your World

Deletes the teleporting fog around and below the world. Portals (and other mods) are the only way to travel to a new world.
World Scale influences initial terrain spawning boundries. use a value between 0 and 5
World Density does not do very much currently. I find it best to leave it around 100.
Terrain Index lets you pick a specific world type. Will be used in the future for spawning rehaul (probably). leave at -1 to use game default settings

All terrain options will _not_ take effect until entering a portal for the first time on loading the game.
